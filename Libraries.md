# WebGL Libraries

Libraries/Frameworks all have one goal: **Use abstraction to allow you to spend more time developing your application**

With this, we are not here to judge or say which library is "better" as that is not a feasible question to answer. So what we **can** offer is a chart to show you what each library has to offer in terms of things it will help abstracts for you

> **X** -> Supports features
>
> **/** -> Can be supported with 3rd-party library
