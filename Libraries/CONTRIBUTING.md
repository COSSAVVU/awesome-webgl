> If you forget any of these I will nicly ask you to change it in the pull request.

**NOTE:** Just because the library isn't in the README.md file doesn't mean it can't be in the Libraries.md file

# Updating [Features.md](https://github.com/sjfricke/awesome-webgl/blob/master/Libraries.md)

- Always keep lines aligned vertically to make it easier to edit.
- Feel free to edit/add in the Column Key.
- If adding or removing a mark from the table please acknowledge why you made that desicion in your pull request description.
  - If adding, put the `**X**` left aligned in the box.
- If adding a library make sure it is in alphabetical order.
  - Also make the name linked to the libraries' main page.
- If adding a column you need to do the following:
  - Make sure it is placed in alphabetical order.
  - add the spaces to each row for that column (Alt+Shift in Notepad++ takes care of that easily).
  - Add in the Column Key in the alphabetical order and give description for what that column means.
  - Use the [Category](#category) format to link it to the Column Key.

# Updating [File_Size.md](https://github.com/sjfricke/awesome-webgl/blob/master/Libraries.md)

- Always keep lines aligned vertically to make it easier to edit.
- If adding a library make sure it is in alphabetical order.
  - Also make the name linked to the libraries' main page.
- All sizes are listed as either:
  - MB with 2 decimal places.
  - KB as MB with leading zero and 3 decimal.

> **MATH NOTE**: 400KB != 0.400MB
>
> You need to divid by 1024
>
> So 400KB is 400 / 1024 = 0.332MB
