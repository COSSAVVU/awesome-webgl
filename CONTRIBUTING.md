Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

> If you forget any of these I will nicly ask you to change it in the pull request.

# Updating [README.md](https://github.com/sjfricke/awesome-webgl/blob/master/README.md)

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- You can either add a link or new categories, or improvements... all are welcome.
  - If you have other ideas for discussion please leave an issue.
- Use the following format: \[NAME\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
  - Keep descriptions simple.
- Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
- Make pull request titles descriptive i.e. not `Updated README`.
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New entires for the libraries/frameworks section are placed in alphabetical order.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- End all descriptions with a period.

# Updating [Libraries.md](https://github.com/sjfricke/awesome-webgl/blob/master/Libraries.md)

- Always keep lines aligned vertically to make it easier to edit.
- Feel free to edit/add in the Column Key.
- If adding or removing a mark from the table please acknowledge why you made that desicion in your pull request description.
  - If adding, put the `**X**` or `**/**` left aligned in the box.
- If adding a library make sure it is in alphabetical order.
- If adding a column you need to do the following:
  - Make sure it is placed in alphabetical order.
  - add the spaces to each row for that column (Alt+Shift in Notepad++ takes care of that easily).
  - Add in the Column Key in the alphabetical order and give description for what that column means.
  - Use the [Category](#category) format to link it to the Column Key.

# How to contribute from GitHub.com

- Make sure you have a free GitHub.com account and you are logged in.
- Find an appropriate topic category in the [README.md](https://github.com/sjfricke/awesome-webgl/blob/master/README.md) file to add it under, or add your own if you think it is needed.

  - Create a new branch so you can send your changes in a pull request.
- Add your changes.
- Scroll down to the `Propose file change` box and write a commit message and optional extended description.
