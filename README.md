## What is WebGL

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within 
any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL is integrated completely into all the web standards
of the browser allowing GPU accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas.

WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background. 
WebGL programs consist of control code written in JavaScript and shader code that is executed on a computer's Graphics 
Processing Unit (GPU). [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) is designed and maintained by the non-profit [Khronos Group]().
